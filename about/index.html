          I'm currently running the following notable pieces of software on my
          machines, with all of them being open source projects:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/wmutils">wmutils</a></li>

          </ul>

          All of the software I currently use in my environment is keyboard
          driven. There are a couple of advantages to this, but mainly it's so
          my hands never have to leave the keyboard and this significantly
          speeds up my workflow.

          My main machine is starting to show its age, but I replaced the GPU
          recently to give it new life:
          </p>

            <ul>
              <li>One gigabyte Z67 Motherboard</li>
              <li>i5 2500k @ 4GHz</li>
              <li>Nvidia MSI 970</li>
              <li>8GB 1600MHz Memory</li>
              <li>750W Corsair PSU</li>
            </ul>

          <p>
          Other than my main machine, I'm currently running this server via
          <a href="https://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a>
          as the github student developer pack was kind enough to give a
          whopping $100 credit to any prospective student who has a University
          email.

          I also have a Acer C720 Chromebook for portable development which
          again runs Arch Linux. It's a fantastic little piece of hardware for the
          price and I would whole heartedly recommend it.

          I currently have two mechanical keyboards, the first one being a
          CoolerMaster QuickFire TK with Cherry MX blues, used primarily for
          playing RTS and MOBA games. I don't like the feel of the blues for
          typing for long periods of time as I find the keys slightly too heavy
          for my liking.

          Enter the brand new Poker 3, overall a much smaller keyboard as it's
          a 60%.  However, it's got Cherry MX reds, which are slightly lighter
          than blues, at 45G to the blues 55G. It's a different switch type
          overall, as the pressure while pressing the key remains equal all
          the way to the bottom. The Poker 3 also has the capability to record
          key presses and replay them back, much like Vim's recording feature.
          However, it's implemented on the keyboard itself and thus can be
          used across machines. Pretty handy. I primarily use it with the
          chromebook when I am out and about!  </p>
