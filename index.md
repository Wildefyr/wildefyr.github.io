Welcome to my {personal} website. Enjoy your stay.

I'm a 20 year old linux hobbyist. I like messing around with Linux
distributions and systems deployment. I'm quite proficient with shell
scripting and it wherever I can. This website for example is built with some
simple shell scripts and Makefiles, without having to use any new-fangled
javascript framework. Minimalism is best.
