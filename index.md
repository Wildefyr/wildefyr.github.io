Welcome to my {personal} website. Enjoy your stay.

    $ whois wildefyr

I'm a twenty years old linux hobbyist. I like messing around with Linux
distributions and systems deployment. I'm quite proficient with shell
scripting and use it whenever I can. This website for example is built with
markdown, some simple shell scripts and Makefiles, without having to use any
new-fangled framework that everyone else is using. Minimalism is best.

A query on IRC will get my attention the fastest usually:

* IRC: [Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net), #crux, #6c37
* Email: [me@wildefyr.net](mailto:me@wildefyr.com)

I also have a teamspeak server available on this
[domain](ts3server://wildefyr.net) that I may or may not be on depending on
the time of day.
