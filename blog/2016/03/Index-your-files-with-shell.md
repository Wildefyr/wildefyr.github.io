# Index your files with shell!
## 2016-03-04

I've been using nginx for sometime now, especially as it's configuration files
are much more /human/ friendly than Apache's, along with it being high
performance. Sadly one option has left me saddened at it's lack of
configuration - autoindex. My main gripe with it being that it's lacking the
option to show dotfiles, which I need to show .footprint and .md5sum files in
my [ports collection](/ports), also the output isn't fantastically pretty.
My solution to this is to generate the needed HTML with nothing but a shell
script. As I'm lazy, I added the following in my nginx.conf:

    add_before_body /html/head.html;
    add_after_body /html/foot.html;

This way I always have my header and footer showed on the page and I only have
to worry about generating the actual content, resulting in the following
piece of code:

    html() {
        printf '%s' "<pre><code>" > index.html
        printf "<a href=\"../\">../</a>\n" >> index.html

        find . -maxdepth 0 -exec ls -A {} \; | while IFS= read -r file; do
            test "$file" = "index.html" && continue
            date=$(du --time ${file} | awk '{print $2,$3}')
            size=$(du -hs ${file} | awk '{print $1}')

            test "$size" = "0" && size="-"

            printf "\
    <div id=\"alignfile\">\
    <a href=\"${file}\">${file}</a>\
    </div>\
    <div id=\"aligndata\">\
    <span id=\"alignsize\">${size}</span>\t\
    <span id=\"aligndate\">${date}</span>\t\
    </div>\n" >> index.html
        done

        printf '%s\n' "</code></pre>" >> index.html
    }

    # generate html
    generate() {
        # generate main index.html using crux specific tools
        type crux 2>&1 > /dev/null && {

            rsync -aq /usr/ports/wild-crux-ports/* ./

            httpup-repgen && portspage . | sed '1,43d' | sed -n '/Generated by/q;p' > index.html
            printf '%s\n' "<li><a href="/ports/wildefyr.git">Git Sync</a></li>" >> index.html
            printf '%s\n' "<li><a href="/ports/wildefyr.httpup">Httpup Sync</a></li>" >> index.html
        }

        for dir in */; do
            cd "$dir"
            html
            cd ../
        done
    }

    generate

Along with this small piece of CSS, to properly align the elements:

    #alignfile {
        display: inline-block;
        min-width: 600px;
    }

    #aligndata {
        min-width: 224px;
        display: inline-block;
    }

    #aligndate {
        float: left;
    }

    #alignsize {
        float: right;
    }


When I run `./ports.sh`, this will generate an index.html in each directory,
with anything that `ls -A` can find in that directory, along with a link to
the previous folder with the `../` reference. It's much more hackable too, as
I can now place any information in any format about the file I want!

# But wait! It gets better!

Now I want to get rid of autoindex completely for my [media](/media) folder
too, but now unlike my ports collection, where I only have to generate the
HTML when I copy new Pkgfiles I have over on my system, I need to generate the
HTML whenever I create or delete a file.

I use a similar script to the one above to create the HTML, but I also use
[wendy](http://git.z3bra.org/wendy/log.html), an event notifier that can be
used to detect changes to a folder or a file, then run a command. For example:

    wendy -m 768 -f ./media ./media.sh

Now when wendy detects a change in ./media, it'll run `media.sh` again to
regenerate the new HTML with the new file listed! Now I just run the above
command in my Makefile to start wendy up when I build the site. I also guess I
can finally say I generate all my HTML on my site with nothing but shell
scripts!

For reference, both the scripts and the Makefile is [available in my website
git repository](https://github.com/Wildefyr/wildefyr.net).

Happy hacking!
