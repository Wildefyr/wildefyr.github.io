            So, you've got your brand new lightweight window manager going.
            Chances are, you're using at least some keyboard hotkeys to manage
            it, whether it's a tiling, floating or dynamic window manager.
            Before trying to find shortcuts and combinations that work for you
            and your workflow, I recommend looking at rebinding the modifier
            keys around your keyboard.
            </p>

            <p>
            A lightweight solution I've found to doing this is with xmodmap.
            While it allows remapping of keys to create your own layout when
            using X, it also allows you to change the modifiers. To start,
            create a file with your favourite text editor and put this at the
            the top of the file:
            </p>

<pre><code>
clear lock
clear control
clear mod1
clear mod2
clear mod3
clear mod4
clear mod5

</code></pre>

            <p>
            Next we can choose what keys we want represented by mod[1-5] and
            add our control keys back:
            </p>

<pre><code>
add control = Control_L Control_R
add mod1    = Alt_L
add mod2    = Alt_R
add mod3    = Hyper_L
add mod4    = Super_L Super_R
add mod5    = Num_Lock

keycode 37  = Hyper_L
keycode 66  = Control_L
keycode 105 = Control_L
keycode 133 = Control_L

</code></pre>

            <p>
            Unforuntely due to my keyboard (QuickFire TK) I need Num_Lock to be
            bound else I can't switch between my number pad and the more useful
            functions like the insert and delete keys. My examples also show
            where I bind Hyper_L and Control_L (Hyper_L goes to the normal
            position of Control_L and Control_L replaces CapsLock and a couple
            of other keys), but on other systems the keycodes might vary.
            </p>

            <p>
            For future reference, you can save all your current keybindings
            into a file like so:
            </p>

            <pre><code>$ xmodmap -pke > keybindings.txt </code></pre>

            <p>
            Save the file and put it in a location of your choosing. Now to
            load it everytime you load into X, just place the following into
            your ~/.xinitrc:
            </P>

            <pre><code>xmodmap /path/to/file</code></pre>

            <p>
            After you've done all this, you can then either use your window
            manager config file to bind the modifiers to combinations, or run a
            separate keybind program like sxhkd to use your now remapped
            modifiers. One tiny limitation I've found is that X apparently only
            has support for a maximum of 5 modifier keys, but that, at least
            for me, covers all of my modifiers.
